## Description

A Spiky blob platformer to represent anxiety. As someone with anxiety myself I wanted to represent what getting through day to day life is like with anxiety constantly having to get around obstacles. This game should evoke a feeling of uneasiness and frustration by having to re-try the levels after dying from one of the spikes. The game is also a take on the Sushi Go mechanics we played in class by being able to choose which spikes you want to keep and which to randomize in order to customize the level and choose the games difficulty. You can press 'R' to regenerate the heights of the spikes and 'G' generate a new layout for them. Then you can click the spikes to lock them in place and click them a second time to unlock them. I chose the colors red, grey and black to convey negative emotions and chose to make almost everything spiky to represent the feeling of anxiety in the body.
